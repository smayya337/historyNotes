# The American Revolution
## Causes
### Seven Years' War
* Basically a continuation of the War of Austrian Succession
* Austria trying to get Silesia back
* Became a global conflict, with European powers fighting in North America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and India
* Fighting ended with the British victorious, the French withdrawing from everywhere, and Britain broke
  * England got all French territory in N.A. east of the Mississippi
  * Spain got all territory west of the Mississippi
### Salutary Neglect
* Not paying attention to what the colonists are doing
* Multiple phases
  * 1607 to 1696: England had no coherent imperial policy
  * 1696 to 1763: Tried to form a coherent policy (Navigations Acts), but they didn't work out
  * 1763 onward: Actually tried to use a coherent imperial policy
* With the Treaty of Paris (1763) settled, England became a major power
* Royal Proclamation Line of 1763: Colonists cannot live west of the Appalachians
  * Land west of Appalachians was hotly contested with natives, and Britain didn't want to waste more money protecting the colonists
* Britain sent more troops to the Americas
* The Grenville Acts
  * Currency Act (1764): No paper currency

* Lord North
  * Repeals all the Townshend duties except the Tea Act
    * Specifically meant to bail out the East India Company
    * Significantly cheaper tea hurt American merchants and smugglers
    * Still a tax; opposed on principle
* Due to the Boston Tea Party and similar acts, Parliament passed the Coercive/Intolerable Acts (1774)
  * Boston port completely closed until tea is paid for
  * Reduced power of MA legislature while increasing royal governor's power
    * Eventually Thomas Gage becomes military governor
  * All British officials and soldiers had to be sent to England for major trials
