* Caused fundamental changes in society
  * Almost every aspect of life has been affected by the Industrial Revolution
* Increase in production brought about by machines and characterized by new energy sources
* New inventions increased speed/output, which led to demands for resources, which led to more inventions
* James Watt greatly improved the steam engine
* Why did it start in Europe?
  * "eUrOpEaNs ArE bEtTer" -Europeans
  * Freer political institutions
  * Strong property rights
  * Small populations -> labor-saving inventions
  * Coal is important to production - large supplies near surface in Britain made it easier to start Industrial Revolution
  * Britain had the highest wages in the world at the start of the 18th century, so machines seemed to be a good way to save money
  * High demand for cotton textiles (originally from India) led to British industrialists trying to compete with Indians
* Steam engines haven't really been improved upon
* There are so many causes that the causes have causes
* China and India were actually at about the same industrial level as Europe in 1800
