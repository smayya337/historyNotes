# Forces and Newton's Laws

## Newton's Laws

### First Law - Inertia

* If $\sum\vec{F} = 0 \rightarrow \vec{a} = 0$
  * No external and resultant are same
* Inertia: Resistance to acceleration
  * Mass
* Reference frame
  * Perspective to measure things
* Inertial reference frame
  * First Law is true

### Second Law - Net Forces

* Forces cause acceleration across different masses
  * Newtons
* $\sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a} \rightarrow \sum F_x = ma_x, \sum F_y = ma_y, \sum F_z = ma_z$
* $\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt} = m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m\vec{a}$
  * Rate of change of momentum proportional to force
* Choose inertial reference frame
  * No fictitious forces

### Third Law - Equal & Opposite

* Works in non-inertial reference frames
* All forces between 2 bodies are equal magnitude, opposite direction
  * Action/reaction
* Exerted on different bodies

## Free Body Diagrams (FBDs)

* Depict all forces on object
* 4 basic mechanical forces
  * Gravity
  * Normal force
  * Tension
  * Friction
* Not included:
  * Internal forces
  * Forces exerted by body
