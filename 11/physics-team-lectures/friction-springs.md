# Friction and Springs

## Friction

* Nothing is perfectly smooth
  * There will be resistance
  * Amount of resistance varies based on:
    * Roughness of surfaces
    * Surface area in contact
    * Normal forces
* This is friction.
  * Main types: static and kinetic

### Kinetic Friction

* Force of friction when objects move with respect to each other
* Uses coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$
* $|F| = \mu_k|N|$, direction opposes motion
* Be careful with rolling! Rolling without slipping uses static friction

### Static Friction

* Force of friction when objects don't move with respect to each other
* Uses coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$
* $|F| \leq \mu_s|N|$, direction cancels out force
* Once magnitude of force passes threshold, object starts to move and friction becomes kinetic

## Springs

* Springs have a natural length at which they are at equilibrium
* Springs have a restorative force that tries to bring the system back to equilibrium
* Hooke's law: $F = -kx$
* To solve for $x(t)$: $x(t) = A\sin{((\frac{k}{m})^{\frac{1}{2}}t)} + B\cos{((\frac{k}{m})^{\frac{1}{2}}t)}$
* $t = \frac{\pi\sqrt{m}}{2\sqrt{R}}$
