# The Protestant Reformation
* Notes:
  * Many 16th-century religious movements can be called "reformations"
  * The polemical tradition that sees only the opposition between Protestants and Catholics fails to do justice to anyone
    * Many branches of Protestantism
      * Lutheran
      * Calvinist
      * Anglican
  * "Reformation" can mean "make better" or "make over"
## Context
### What's Happening in the Church?
* Great Schism of the West
  * 1378-1417
  * Two, then three rival popes
    * Followers among national lines
  * Still attempts at rival popes until middle of 15th century
* Kept burning through Popes
  * Ten (nine) Popes between Nicholas V (1447) and Leo X (1513)
    * They started good, but just got worse
      * Alexander VI
        * Probably bribed his way into the papacy
        * Had illegitimate kids as a cardinal
        * Didn't respect the job
### Selling Indulgences
* Purgatory (to Catholics) was a place where people were cleansed of their sins before going to Heaven
* Indulgences reduced time in Purgatory
* Church needed $$$ for St. Peter's Basilica 2: Electric Boogaloo, so the Pope allowed the sale of indulgences
* People didn't stop sinning, they just bought indulgences
* Damnable abuse
  * Carelessness
  * Confusion between payment of money as alms, and money as purchase
  * People thought indulgences were basically absolutions
* Indulgence profits were shared between the Papal See and the indebted Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg
## Martin Luther

* Went to university
* Joined Augustinians and became a priest
* Visited Rome
* Taught at University of Wittenberg
* Influenced by Christian humanism
  * Disliked scholasticism
  * Accepted criticism of the Church
* Really sensitive
  * Prone to pessimism
* Could not convince himself of his own worthiness in the eyes of God (scrupulosity)
* Could not believe his actions could help him
### 1516
* Johan Tetzel (Dominican priest) began preaching an indulgence to raise money

* Published three different treatises
  * *Address to the German Nobility* called on noblemen to abolish payments to Rome and banning clerical celibacy, masses for the dead, pilgrimages, and religious orders
  * *On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church* stated that the Church was stuck denying communion (bread and wine) to laymen and imposing transubstantiation, making only baptism and the Eucharist valid sacraments
  * *On the Freedom of a Christian Man* claimed that salvation depended on faith and grace, and that the ordinary person didn't have to do good works to secure a spot in Heaven
